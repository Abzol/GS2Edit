Sometime in 2008, Atrius made a romhacking tool for Golden Sun: The Lost Age.
Development stopped in 2012.
Thankfully he posted the source code after ceding maintenance.
While it still works, it's fairly slow, windows only, and GUI only.

Let's fix that, slowly but surely.
An excellent adventure begins here.

For more information on the original project, it is hosted by Atrius [here](http://forum.goldensunhacking.net/index.php?topic=1.0)

The program requires a Golden Sun: The Lost Age english ROM.
For legal reasons, one can not be provided.
